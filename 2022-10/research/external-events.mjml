      Beginning to Teach for ECRs and HDRs

    </mj-text>
    <mj-text mj-class="subsection-content">

      Beginning to Teach (BTT) is designed to develop the teaching capability of UNSW Early Career Researchers (ECRs) and Higher Degree Research candidates (HDRs) with little to no experience of teaching.

The program was proposed by UNSW Research and developed by the Academic Development team in the PVCESE. It draws on the expertise of UNSW academics and the experience of UNSW students.

BTT introduces participants to a range of topics and issues in learning and teaching that are key to getting started with teaching. Sessions explore perspectives on student learning, good practice in how to plan and facilitate a learning experience, and the basics of assessment and feedback. The program also gives participants the opportunity to plan, facilitate and evaluate a short teaching session.

Program fees for UNSW ECRs and HDRS will be sponsored by the University upon admission into this program.
