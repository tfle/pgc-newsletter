            <p>The team behind the PGC have been hard at work putting together a series of events for this term, including a networking night, panels on research translation and postgrad parenting, workshops on public speaking and EndNote, and a seminar on rights, research and AI. The second half of the year lends itself to a lot of excitement as we gear up for the annual Arc PGC Research Awards, now in its 13th year of running, and of course, the PGC elections where you can nominate and vote for your student representatives. With something on every week from now until the end of July, itâ€™s a great time to get involved!</p>
