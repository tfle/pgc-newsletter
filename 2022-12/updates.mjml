        ADHD Climb Stories

      </h4>
      <p>
        In October, the PGC hosted a Sydney Harbour Bridge climb to raise awareness about ADHD especially among the postgraduate cohort. We thank the members of our postgraduate community who took part in this event and who share their lived experiences <a href="https://fb.watch/h92pm8-Pij/">in this video</a>.
	Feel free to check out <a href="https://aadpa.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Talking-About-ADHD-Poster-7.pdf">this poster</a> which gives an overview of what ADHD is and how to talk about it.

      <p>
      
        After a temporary hiatus, the PGC Cruise Party made a roaring comeback last month with more than 300 people onboard to see the beautiful Sydney Harbour and stunning Sydney CBD skyline. Thank you for all coming together again in style and making the event such a success! We can't wait to announce the 2023 edition and see you all on the dance floor once more.
