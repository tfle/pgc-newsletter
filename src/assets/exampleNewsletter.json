The second half of the year lends itself to a lot of excitement as we gear up for the annual Arc PGC Research Awards, now in its 13th year of running, and of course, the PGC elections where you can nominate and vote for your student representatives. With something on every week from now until the end of July, it’s a great time to get involved!","highlights":[{"title":"Postgrad Series","description":"Coming up: Networking Night, Public Speaking & Presenting, Research Translation Panel, Rights, Research & AI Seminar, Postgrads Parenting Panel, EndNote Workshop","imageUrl":"https://www.arc.unsw.edu.au/uploads/postgrad-series-2024.jpg","link":"https://www.arc.unsw.edu.au/events/postgrad-series","featured":true,"dateTime":"Tues, 18 Jun - Thu, 1 Aug"},{"title":"Let's Play Soccer with PGC","description":"Join us for a fun soccer match!
