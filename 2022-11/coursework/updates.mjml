        Cockatoo Island Visit â€“ Saturday 3rd September 2022

      </h4>
      <p>
      
        The Cockatoo Island visit was booked out and despite the rainy weather, postgraduate students met at Barangaroo and made their way to Cockatoo Island by ferry.
We had the opportunity to meet fellow postgraduate students and make new friends.
Our tour guide provided an exciting and insightful tour of Cockatoo Island which provided a unique perspective through learning about Australia's military and convict history.
