            <p style="font-weight:500">Happy Flexi Week!</p>
            <p>This month we're saying welcome to a new batch of HDR candidates, a flexible Week 6 for coursework students, and a week of celebration in recognising our diversity at UNSW and in Australia. Since O-Week, weâ€™ve appointed 25 new committee members across the PGC who will be working closely with Office Bearers and Committee Liaisons to represent the postgraduate student voice. If you have a moment, please come say hello to them at our events or drop by one of our monthly meetings to stay in touch with what each PGC Office is up to!</p>
