      Burnout Seminar
    </mj-text>
    <mj-text mj-class="subsection-content">
      <p>Have you ever felt Burnout? Burnout is a state of exhaustion that stems from excessive and prolonged stress (did anyone say Post-Grad studies?). It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands.</p>
      <p>Bridey Martin, who is an excellent Student Support Advisor at UNSW, will be leading a seminar on the 22nd September at 11am. Here she will inform you of what Burnout is, how to prevent it, and what to do when you find yourself in a state of Burnout.</p>
